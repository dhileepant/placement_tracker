# Placement Tracker Dashboard

This is my Placement Tracker Dashboard project. I built this application to help track placement progress and visualize key metrics for students and administrators.

## What I Did

- Implemented charts, progress tracking, and admin/student views
- Integrated authentication and data management
- Deployed the website using Vercel
